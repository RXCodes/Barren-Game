# Description
An evil tribe has invaded your land and inflicted chaos on multiple villages. They drained all of the water and life force of your territory, leaving everything barren. Your father died in a tragic battle against these monsters, and you are the last hope to protect and serve your land. Your people are counting on you to restore peace - can you do it?

**Barrens** is a top-down story-based western shooter where you can navigate through villages and fight enemies. You can upgrade your gear to make progressing through the game easier. Interact with NPCs throughout the world, find spells, browse the shop and more!

# Project Goal & Relevance
*This is top-down western shooter game created using Godot for CSE 350.* The goal of our project is to develop an engaging 2D top-down game using the **Godot** engine. Our game will focus on creating an appealing and immersive world where players can interact with a variety of NPCs and enemies. Our aim is to build core mechanics related to game design, such as: character movement, AI, level design, and sprite animations to enhance the experience and make the game not only fun, but interactive in every way.

Through this project, we will enhance our programming skills by learning a new programming language, `GDScript`, and also while gaining valuable experience working as a cohesive team. By using open-source material, creating our own assets, and collaborating through GitHub, we hope to communicate effectively which is vital for our project's success. By doing something none of us have done before, we will learn a completely new perspective of programming we are not used to. 

The relevance of this project is in the opportunity to use tools like **Godot** and **GitHub**, which are often utilized in industry level projects.  While learning to create a product that requires creative problem-solving, technical knowledge, and teamwork, our group will be pushed to our boundaries, developing essential, and new skills applicable to future software development projects and other programming aspects. Video games are extremely popular and opens opportunities for new jobs while also having fun. Our game will be playable on the browser, requiring no prior downloads, which makes it extremely accessible and monetizable.
